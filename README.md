## Analysis 
* The district summary was to establish the amount of students, the total budget, the average reading and math grades, and the percentage of passing grades. The key take aways is that out of the 15 schools in the district with the combined 39,170 students, the average math score was 78.98, the average reading score was 81.87, the percent passing for math was 74%, the percent passing for reading was 85%, and the overall passing rate was 65%.

* The school summary was broke down all of the same categories but by each school. This allowed us to see the individual performance of each school. From this we were able to determine the ranking of each school and which ones had the highest and lowest overall passing rate. 

* Furthermore, we were also able to determine the reading and math averages by grade. Again, this allowed us to see the individual performace of each school and each grade within that school.

* We also categorized the per capita by student, school size, and school type and determine the average reading and math scores as well as the passing rates. From this we were able to determine the performance of students based on how much they spend for school, the size of their school, and what type of school that they go to. 

## Conclusions
* Two conclusions that can be drawn from these calculations is typically the more a student spends on their education, the worse they perform in terms of average scores, and overall passing rate. Furthermore, it can be concluded that Chater school students perform better in both reading and math, and have a substantially higher overall passing rate.
